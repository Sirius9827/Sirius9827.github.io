# Personal Profile Website

This is a simple, modern personal profile website. It includes sections for education, projects, internships, research interests, studied courses, and certifications. Social links (including GitHub) are provided in the footer.

## Structure
- `index.html`: Main HTML file. Update your information here.
- `styles.css`: CSS for styling the website.
- `profile-placeholder.jpg`: Placeholder profile image (SVG). Replace with your own photo if desired.

## How to Use
1. **Update your information**: Edit `index.html` and fill in your real name, contact info, education, projects, internships, research interests, courses, and certifications.
2. **Add new sections**: Copy and modify the structure of existing sections in `index.html`.
3. **Change profile image**: Replace `profile-placeholder.jpg` with your own image (110x110px recommended).
4. **Customize styles**: Edit `styles.css` to change colors, fonts, or layout.

## Deployment
You can deploy this site using GitHub Pages or any static web hosting service.
